# Qubit-by-Qubit---Quantum-Computing
This repository contains the final project I worked on at the end of the two-semester Introduction to Quantum Computing offered by The Coding School, sponsored by IBM Quantum.
This project extends the work I did weeks before the end of the second semester. 
This project basically builds upon the building blocks of Quantum error correction and ultimately culminates in the implementation of Shor's code; Shor's code is an extremely important concept in the field of Quantum error correction and Quantum Computing in general.
